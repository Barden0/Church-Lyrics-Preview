I see blind eyes opened
Deaf ears unstopped 

The lame are walking 
The withered are now restored 

As spoken in your word 
The power of God is here 
As spoken in your word 
Your power’s at work in me and towards me 

To heal and to restore,
I received here and now— 
As spoken in your word.

All diseases there is a cure 
There’s no impossibility this is my place of encounters

As spoken in your word 
The power of God is here 
As spoken in your word 
Your power’s at work in me and towards me 

To heal and to restore ,
I received here and now— 
As spoken in your word.

As the waters covers the seas 
So as your glory
Fills the earth 

So we wait on you 
To pour out your rain
Your rain to fill the earth.

-

Everytime that we gather in your name 
You are hearing us in the fullness of your spirit

And as we lift our voice to worship and pray 
Lord we open our hearts to you

As you fill our hearts
With your passion and your dreams

With hunger to see your glory fill the earth
You fill our hearts with your purpose and plans
Oh Jesus, it's by your Spirit

We yield our hearts to you
No resistance at all
As you work in us and make us better

You are the builder Lord
And we are your edifice
Lord, you work in us and make us better

Feeble hearts strengthened
Burn with fresh fire
And strange desires consumed in your fire

-

In all the nations
In all the earth
Jesus exalted, over men's lives

And all they want
And all they see
Is His glory upon the earth

-

What a mighty God we serve 
The angels now before thee 

Heaven and earth Adore thee 
What a mighty God we serve
