1. Hosanna in the highest
Let our King be lifted up
Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Let our King be lifted up
Hosanna

2. Be lifted high
Be lifted high 
Oh Lord be lifted high
For you are holy, righteous and worthy
Oh Lord be lifted high

3. Father in heaven, how we love you.
We lift your Name in all the earth.
May your kingdom, be established in our praises,
As your people declare your mighty works.

Blessed be the Lord God Almighty
Who was and is, and is, to come.
Blessed be the Lord God Almighty.
Who reigns forever more.

4. What is man
But your workmanship designed to depend on you
What is man
But one designed to rely on your  grace

What is life without you
What is time not spent for you 
Oh Jesus I desire you 
And my praise starts with you
Yes my worship ends with you 
oh Jesus I surrender to you 

When the music fades away
And the best tunes no more played 
Oh Jesus, my focus remains you
When the cheers are all gone
And my peers not around 
Oh Jesus I'll still hold on to you.
